# DesktopPet

This started as a small little fun project for my work machine.
Then a few friends wanted it, so I added a auto update feature.
And now I figure I may as well put it fully online for anyone to enjoy.

**Install**
If all you want to do is install it, download the latest release zip.
Extract to anywhere and run the EXE

**Compile**
If you want to download the source code yourself and compile.
Download the DesktopPet, BuildPet.bat and setup.bat files from above.
Check the code if you like, then run the setup, then build bat files to build your EXE

**Update**
The program will automatically prompt to update if there is one avalibale.
