# DesktopPet

This started as a small little fun project for my work machine.
Then a few friends wanted it, so I added a auto update feature.
And now I figure I may as well put it fully online for anyone to enjoy.

**Install**<br>
If all you want to do is install it, download the latest release zip.
Extract to anywhere and run the EXE

**Compile**<br>
If you want to download the source code yourself and compile.
Download the project from github.
Make sure you have python installed.
I recommend using the version from the windows store as that is what I used when creating this app.
Check the code if you like, then run the setup, then build bat files to build your EXE

**Update**<br>
The program will automatically prompt to update if there is one avalibale.
