**Note:**<br>
Some things detect this as unsafe, that is because of the auto updater (I think)<br>
If you are unsure about running this, feel free to download the code and make the EXE yourself<br>

This started as a small little fun project for my work machine.<br>
Then a few friends wanted it, so I added a auto update feature.<br>
And now I figure I may as well put it fully online for anyone to enjoy.<br>

**Install**<br>
If all you want to do is install it, download the latest release zip.
Extract to anywhere and run the EXE

**Compile**<br>
If you want to download the source code yourself and compile.
Download the project from github.
Make sure you have python installed.
I recommend using the version from the windows store as that is what I used when creating this app.
Check the code if you like, then run the BuildPet.bat file to build your EXE
It will export in the Dist folder

**Update**<br>
The program will automatically prompt to update if there is one avalibale.
